        <h2 style="color: #4CAF50;">üéµ About the project</h2>
        <p>While going through a break-up, I tried to distract myself with music - just like most of us do. 
            However, I quickly realised that songs weren't of much help: almost all of them were cherishing love and feelings, exactly the one thing in the world I didn't want to think about.</p>
        <p>I started wondering: is love indeed the most prevailing topic in all countries and languages? And can it be so that in different countries, different topics are preferred? One could blindly suppose the topic of money to be popular in the US, and the topic of politics, for example, in Russia.</p>
        <p>And since I had to choose a project for my Computational Linguisitcs class, I decided to explore my idea using computational methods.</p>
